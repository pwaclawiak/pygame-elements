# Pygame-elements
A repository to store separate elements / systems made with pygame that can be later reused in other projects.

The purpose is to build a portfolio of things I have created and implemented in my various projects that take some time to make and store them in one place for easy access. Also all of the elements should be runnable without bigger context of a whole game, so that it is easy to test (and possibly modify), as well as to show to other people.
